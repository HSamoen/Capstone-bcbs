                <h1>WHAT IS FOOD INSECURITY?</h1>
                <p>According to a federal standard, food security refers to a household's capacity to supply adequate food for each member to have an active, healthy life. One method of assessing the danger of hunger is food insecurity.</p>

                <h1>IMPROVING HEALTH WITH ACCESS TO FOOD</h1>
                <p>Having access to healthy foods is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Without access to healthy foods, a nutritious diet, and good health are unattainable. Nutritious eating and physical activity can provide individuals with proper nutrition and energy, the maintenance of optimal weight, and a lower risk of diseaseâ€”including high blood pressure, cancer, and type-2 diabetes.</p>

                <h1>Food Insecurity Leads to Hunger</h1>
                <p>Food insecurity can also lead to hunger. Every year, hunger costs billions of dollars, with the US spending around $178.9 billion of that total. Because of this, more money is spent by the government on national food security rather than infrastructure, healthcare, and educational initiatives.</p>

                <h1>A Rise in Health-related Costs</h1>
                <p>The chance of getting chronic diseases like heart disorders increases with the level of food insecurity. As a result, the healthcare system is under stress. According to a research, households with food insecurity spent $6,100 on medical care annually compared to $4,200 for households with food security, a 45% increase in costs.</p>
